# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
`/products/5`, because the variable after the second slash, `id`, should be a numerical value, like `5`

While `/products/5` would match, it is not the only one. 
A query parameter can be any value inserted into the url, it does not have to be a number, even if it is called id. So :id can represent any value.
